# DC and CSMA Simulator for SRDs
This is the location of a discrete event simulator, developed using the C programming language, which enables to simulate the behavior of a Short Range Device (SRD) network, namely it allows to assess the performance of Duty-Cycling (DC) and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) channel access mechanisms (independently and in coexisting scenarios).

The "[Simulator code](Simulator%20code/)" folder contains the source code, whereas the file "[Simulator description.pdf](Simulator%20description.pdf)" describes in detail the simulator.
